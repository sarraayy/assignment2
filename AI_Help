This document explains how I used assistance with parts B and C, which was used as a learning aid throughout my code.
AI assistance was used to clarify concepts, fix code issues and improve my understanding of Transformer KV-cache behavior.


##Part B: KV-Cache Theory and Architecture
Tasks:
- Write explanations for KV-cache architecture, bandwisth/computation analysis and memory footprint
- Describe how cache placement, quantization, and effeciency impact inference

Challenges faced:
- Understanding how the KV-cache actually stores keys and values across decoding steps.
- Connecting theoretical ideas (O(S^2)) -> O(S) scaling, bandwidth vs compute) to real hardware behavior

How AI helped:
I asked prompts such as:
- "Can you explain how the KV cache works in Transformers and why it improves inference speed?"
- "How does cache precision affect energy efficiency?"
- "Can you explain Latency scaling with sequence length?"

AI provided structured explanations and examples that clarified my understanding of memory trade-offs and afficiency
I used these insights to rewrite/add on to my responses in my own words.

##Part C: Coding Experiments
Tasks:
- Implementing and running experiments measuring performance with/without KV-Cache, batching effects and precision
- Record timing, memory usage and throughput results for each task

Challenges faced:
- Setting up the base script (run_model.py) correctly using AutoModelCausalLM
- Debudding issues with tokenizer padding, CSV writing
- Understanding how to measure memory (psutil) and timing in a repeatable way

How AI helped:
I asked prompts such as:
-"Why do I get a padding error with Distilgpt-2 when batching?"
- "How can I fix my memory measurement code using psutil in python?"
-"Can you check my code and help me understand why I am recieving this error, and how I could fix it?"

AI helped me identify syntax and logic errors and explained hoe to properly fix these issues, as well as explain how to properly use tokenizer, caching flags and generation functions.
With this help, I successfully built and ran Experiment 1, 2, and 3, each generating results and outputs correctly.

Reflection:
AI acted as an assitiance/debugger throughout my work, rather than producing final answers with no explanations.
I learned how the Transformer generation process, caching and precision work in practice.
By asking targeted questions and then applying explanations, I gained a clearer understanding to all sides of this assignment.
Overall, AI support, helped me better understand concepts that I wasn't fully confident in or fully understood.
